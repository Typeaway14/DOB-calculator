# DOB-calculator

This is the first android app I created. It takes in the user's date of birth and returns their age in minutes.

## Get Started
Wanna use DOC-calculator for yourself?
  1. Download the files or clone them into a directory on your device.
> Note: Check [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for help on how to clone a repo using the git        commands.
  2. Open the directory in Android Studio and you're good to go.
